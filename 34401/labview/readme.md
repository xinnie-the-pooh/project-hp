3. Known Issues
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver, please contact technical support.

In older firmware, the instruments did not support a VXI-11 abort for Ethernet. This type of abort is sent by NI-VISA when the Abort button is selected in LabVIEW. If the abort is not acknowledged by the instrument, the VI will appear to hang. It is always best to terminate a VI using a stop button provided in the user interface.
In the 34410, using a manual trigger delay with a software trigger may take longer than the configured timing.
On the 34410 and 34411, when software triggering is used for taking multiple samples, a manual trigger delay is set, and a sample time interval is used, a timing violation error will occur.
Buffer overflow errors can occur if data is not read from the instrument's memory buffer fast enough. This issue can be resolved by increasing the trigger delay or sample interval to reduce the measurement speed, or by using a different interface bus.
Using the 34401 on an operating system that does not support DTR/DSR flow control (ex. Linux) requires the user to modify the connection from the PC to the instrument. Basically, this requires the user to tie a pin to logic true and lower the baud rate. See the 34401 manual for more details.
